**This is a sudoku solver and generator. **

Sudoku :  (originally called Number Place) is a logic-based, combinatorial <br>
number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid <br>
with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that <br>
compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the <br>
digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which <br> 
for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.
