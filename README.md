# Sudoku solver and generator!

Rules:
Sudoku : (originally called Number Place) is a logic-based, combinatorial
number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid
with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that
compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the
digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which
for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

For the solution of sudoku, I use Backtracking technique.
